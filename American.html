                        American Airlines has a cancellation policy that varies depending on the fare type. Generally,
                        if you cancel
                        a flight within 24 hours of booking and it was purchased at least two days prior to departure,
                        you’re
                        eligible for a full refund. For non-refundable tickets, cancellations may result in travel
                        credits minus
                        any applicable fees. It's essential to review the specific rules for your ticket class. For

                        for
